## Explanation of the Different Function Creation Methods:

1. **Function Declaration**:
   - The traditional way to declare a function using the `function` keyword.
   
2. **Function Expression**:
   - A function is created and assigned to a variable. This function is **anonymous** (it does not have a name).
   
3. **Arrow Function**:
   - A concise and modern way to write functions, introduced in **ES6**. It has a shorter syntax.
   
4. **Arrow Function with Parameters**:
   - An arrow function that takes **parameters**.

5. **Arrow Function with Implicit Return**:
   - A shorthand for returning values directly from **single-line functions**.

6. **Named Function Expression**:
   - A function expression where the function has a **name** (useful for recursion or debugging).

7. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**:
   - A function expression that is executed **immediately after** it is defined.

8. **Constructor Function**:
   - A function used as a **blueprint** to create objects, typically used with the `new` keyword.

9. **Function as a Parameter**:
   - Passing a **function as an argument** to another function, allowing t
